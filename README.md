## üßπ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The foundation of any robust model lies in clean data. This project meticulously addresses data quality through:

- Handling Missing Values: Employing strategic imputation or removal techniques to ensure data completeness.

- Outlier Detection and Treatment: Identifying and managing extreme values that could negatively impact model training.

- Feature Scaling/Normalization: Applying techniques like StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler to ensure features are on a comparable scale, crucial for Neural Networks.

- Categorical Encoding: Converting categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms.
## üß† Model Training and Optimization
A central aspect of this project is the exploration and optimization of predictive models. We primarily leverage Neural Networks due to their power in capturing complex, non-linear relationships within the data.

- Neural Network Architectures: Experimentation with different layer configurations, activation functions, and regularization techniques to build effective neural network models.
